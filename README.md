# AlexiaTu-BugReports
Finding bugs and recommending features for software I use or open source projects

The goal of this assignment is to help geting more familiar with finding and reporting bugs, as well as becoming more comfortable with utilizing GitHub as a tool for software projects and teamwork within projects. It will help to reenforce the importance of creating an effective bug report for the SDLC, as well as how to do so with the experience using GitHub to make a repository and issue template. 
In this assignment, I create a GitHub repository, make a template for bug reports, and write a comprehensive bug report for any software that I select.
